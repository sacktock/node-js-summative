Using the webpage
-----------------

 - **starting off** - After creating your TMDb account at https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup, the first thing you want to do is authenticate you account to the webpage. 
 Click the authenticate option on the right sidebar, this will redirect you to a TMDb page asking for your permission to allow your account to be used in the webpage.
 Click allow and you will be redirected back to the webpage if the authenticating was successful, if for whatever reason it wasn't you will be told and prompted to try again.
 - **navigating the sidebar** - On the side bar you can navigate to 5 main sections ('Trending', 'Discover', 'Genres', 'People' and 'You') excluding 'Find'. 
 'Trending' displays trending films in the main grid view. 'Discover' gives you the option to display top rated, popular, now playing and upcoming films. 
 'Genres' allows you to display popular films from different genres. 'People' displays popular people (actors and directors etc.). 
 'You' gives you the option to display favourite films or films rated by you (if you have logged in and authenticated). 
 Finally, there is an authentication button to allow you to authenticate your TMDb account with the webpage, a login and create account button that redirect you to the login and create account pages on TMDb's website respectively.
 - **page content** - At the top of the main page content we have the header which displays which section of the webpage you are in. 
 Also in the header is the search bar which will search for a film or a person (depending on which section of the webpage you are in) and display the results in the grid view.
 Directly below we have a film spotlight section displaying the most popular film at the moment, with a view button. And below that we have the grid view displaying the page contents or any query results, each film/person in the grid view also has a view button. 
 Right at the bottom is the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons for pagination of the results.
